# BattleShipMaximus
This was my first original project in C#. The deliverables were given to me by Andy Sterkowitz, whom I consider to be my mentor in software development. 

At first I thought a console app would be too easy but, alas, once I got into it, I began to realize what a great way it is to learn the fundamentals of a language. It kind of reminds me of the ancient UIs I used to see in my childhood in the late 80's and early 90's. But it's also a great way to tune into the syntax and logic of what, at the time, was a completely new language to me.
